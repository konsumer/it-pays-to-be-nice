# It Pays To Be Nice

Kristin Says:
> I had a silly ap idea. whoever has the ap the people could get tipped for being nice. Connect it to pay pal and whenever anyone is nice to you tip them a dollar if they have the ap and they get points also. Call it, "It Pays To Be Nice" Just a random thought i had. It would market itself by anytime someone that has the ap notices someone being nice they ask them if they have the ap. If they do, they ask their name and tip them, if they don't you tell them about the ap and how they could have gotten a tip if they had the ap.
